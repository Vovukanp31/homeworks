<h2>Formation and name</h2>
<p>
    Dinosaur Pile-Up formed after guitarist Bigland's band Mother Vulpine dissolved in 2007. Bigland had been creating
    songs used for Dinosaur Pile-Up whilst he was in Mother Vulpine. Bigland recorded a demo tape consisting of the
    songs "My Rock 'n' Roll", "Love Is a Boat and We're Sinking", "Melanin", "Let's Get Up", "What Howard Said" and "I
    Get My Direction" whilst he was still in Mother Vulpine. A short time later, after Mother Vulpine broke up, Bigland
    recruited Tom Dornford-May on bass and Steve Wilson on drums to complete the line up.
    Matt Bigland has said he thought of the name 'Dinosaur Pile-Up' after watching the 2005 film King Kong. Matt Bigland
    has said in an interview; "I watched the remake of King Kong. Which was pretty bad! It was ages ago, before this
    band, or even the idea of this band ever existed. Anyway, there was this part in it where this stampede of
    dinosaurs, the front one is shot in the leg or something, and it trips up, and then all these huge dinosaurs trip
    up, roll down this hill, and it just ends up in this massive pile up, and everything in between them survives. I
    thought it was ridiculous, and as a joke I said, I have to start a band called Dinosaur Pile-Up.
